  <h2 style="color:darkgreen">About Me</h2>
  <p> I am a M.Sc. student in the Department of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University. I completed my undergraduate degree in Combined Honours in Math and Physics at the University of British Columbia. Currently, I am working on the mathematical modelling of skeletal muscle using continuum models and finite element methods in an interdisciplinary project with the Neuromuscular Mechanics Labratory at SFU under supervision of Dr. Nilima Nigam and Dr. James Wakeling. My research interests are in applied mathematics, mathematical modelling, finite element methods, and mathematical biology.</p>

  <p>I like to spend my free time traveling and exploring the outdoors. My hobbies include hiking, running, climbing, skiing, and painting. </p>
