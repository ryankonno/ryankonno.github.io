  <h2 style="color:darkgreen">About Me</h2>
  <p> I am a PhD student at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. Here, I am working under the supervision of Dr. Taylor Dick in the Neuromuscular Biomechanics Research Labratory. I completed my MSc in the Department of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University and my undergraduate degree in Combined Honours in Math and Physics at the University of British Columbia. My previous research has focused on the mathematical modelling of skeletal muscle using continuum models and finite element methods in an interdisciplinary project with the Neuromuscular Mechanics Labratory at SFU under supervision of Dr. Nilima Nigam and Dr. James Wakeling. My research interests are in biomechanics, applied mathematics, mathematical modelling, numerical analysis, and mathematical biology.</p>

  <p>I like to spend my free time traveling and exploring the outdoors. My hobbies include hiking, running, climbing, skiing, and painting. </p>
